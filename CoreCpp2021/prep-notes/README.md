# Prep Notes

These are the Jupyter notebooks I wrote to develop the talk.

They are not 100% in sync with the talk or the latest code,
but should cover most everything.

Also - there are probably some mistakes that I fixed while writing 
the slides. I did not fix them in the notebooks...

**Important:** Not all the code here runs. Some of it (all the import hacks)
cannot run in a notebook.
This is a notebook because it's easy for me to write it this way.
